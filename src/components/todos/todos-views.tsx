/**
 * The client shell for the sidebar views *and* projects. The server page hands
 * over the *whole* household active task set (plus the logbook page) in one
 * render, and this component derives whichever destination the URL names — a
 * sidebar view (/todos/[view]) or a project (/todos/project/[id]) — so
 * switching either way is a pushState + an in-memory filter, instant, no server
 * roundtrip. Sidebar clicks and `g` chords route here through view-switch.ts;
 * deep links, the back button, and reloads all still resolve through their
 * server route (which renders this same shell).
 *
 * Freshness rides the existing reconcile loop: every mutation's drained
 * router.refresh() re-runs the page for the current (pushed) URL, and the new
 * snapshot updates every view's and project's derivation at once.
